/**
 * Installs sample blog posts using the actual repositories.  Like the other installers this installer will only execute
 * if the version is different.  Unlike the other installers, it only runs after all modules have bootstrapped.  This means
 * all components like services, repositories can be used to perform its tasks.
 * <p/>
 * NOTE: this installer can only be executed once, there is no code supporting updates of any kind, running it more than
 * once will simply insert all data a second time.
